# CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# file contains 11 variables and 3.66m rows and is well over 380Mb. 
# It will take time to download

# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

```

Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)

covid_data <- vroom::vroom(url)%>% # If vroom::vroom(url) doesn't work, use read_csv(url)
  clean_names()

covid_clean <- covid_data %>% 
  select(5,6,9,10,11) %>% 
  group_by(age_group,death_yn) %>% 
  filter(death_yn != "Missing",death_yn !="Unknown" , medcond_yn !="Missing", medcond_yn !="Unknown", sex != "Missing",sex != "Other",    sex != "Unknown", icu_yn != "Unknown", icu_yn != "Missing")


covid_death_medcond <- covid_clean %>% 
  group_by(age_group, sex, medcond_yn, death_yn) %>%
  summarise(Number=n()) %>% 
  mutate(Percentage=Number/sum(Number)*100) %>% 
  filter(death_yn=="Yes")

  icu.labs <- c("Addmited ICU", "Not Admitted ICU")
  names(icu.labs) <- c("Yes", "No")

       geom_text(aes(label=round(Percentage, digits = 1)),hjust=0, vjust=0)
