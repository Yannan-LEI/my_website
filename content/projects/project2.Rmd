##Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here("data", "approval.csv")) 


# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.


approval_polllist <- approval_polllist  %>%
  mutate(modeldate = mdy(modeldate),startdate = mdy(startdate), enddate = mdy(enddate))
glimpse(approval_polllist)


```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("data", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)


approval_polllist_cleaned <- approval_polllist  %>%  
  select(enddate,approve,disapprove ) 
approval_polllist_cleaned

approval_polllist_cleaned$netapprovalrate <- approval_polllist_cleaned$approve - approval_polllist_cleaned$disapprove
approval_polllist_cleaned

approval_polllist_cleaned <- approval_polllist_cleaned %>%  
   mutate (year = year(enddate),
          month = lubridate::month(enddate, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(enddate)) %>%
group_by(year,week) %>%
summarise(mean= mean(netapprovalrate), sd_rate = sd(netapprovalrate),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_rate = sd(netapprovalrate)/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_rate,
            rate_low = mean - margin_of_error,
           rate_high = mean + margin_of_error, .groups = 'drop') 
approval_polllist_cleaned


plot1 <- ggplot(data= approval_polllist_cleaned, mapping = aes(x = week, y = mean, color = year)) +
geom_point()+ geom_line() + theme(legend.position="none") + facet_wrap(~year) + labs( x = " Weak of the year", y = " Average Net Approval %", title = "Estimating Net Approval (approve-disapprove) for Donald Trump", subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls" ) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 52, by = 13))+ scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = -20, to = 7.5, by = 2.5)) + geom_hline(yintercept=0, color = "orange") + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=rate_low, ymax=rate_high), linetype=1, alpha=0.1) + NULL
plot1 

```
We can observe that the range for week 15 is lower than the range for week 34. This means that the degree of certainty of the results is more in week 15 when compared to the degree of certainty of results of week 34. This could be because the average sample size in week 15 is greater than the average sample size in week 34. As the sample size increases, the variation around the mean reduces, giving us a narrower confidence interval.
