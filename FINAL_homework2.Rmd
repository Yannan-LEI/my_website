# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather <- weather %>% 
 select(1:13) %>% 
pivot_longer(cols = 2:13,names_to = "month",values_to = "delta")
tidyweather
```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

#Your code goes here...

plot1 <- ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y=delta)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color = "red") +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Weather Anomalies", x="month") + facet_wrap(~month) + NULL
plot1
```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculates a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}

# choose the interval 2011-present
  
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 

  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(year >= 2011) %>% 
  
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta),
            sd_delta = sd(delta),
            count = n(),
            # get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_delta = sd(delta)/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_delta,
            delta_low = mean_delta - margin_of_error,
            delta_high = mean_delta + margin_of_error)
 formula_ci

```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}
library(infer)

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
bootstrap_dist <- comparison %>% 
  specify(response=delta) %>%
  generate(reps=1000) %>%
  calculate(stat="mean")

# above function calculates the mean of sample 1000 (reps) times

bootstrap_ci <- get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_dist,level = 0.95,type="percentile")
bootstrap_ci


ci2 <- get_confidence_interval(bootstrap_dist,type="se",point_estimate = formula_ci$mean_delta) 
ci2


```

The data shows us (with 95% confidence) that the mean temperature deviation since 2011 has been between 0.944-0.987, close to a 1 degree change. The confidence intervals calculated using either method are quite close with the formulaic method showing us a slightly higher degree of change. The bootstrap method simply runs our study on the sample size 1000 times. In other words, it averages out the results of the study over 1000 repetitions. This has the effect of reducing the standard error and giving us a narrower/tighter confidence interval, increasing the accuracy of the study from a theoretical standpoint. We could enhance accuracy of the formulaic method as well if we increase the sample size but the bootstrap method tries to do that with an iterative approach. In any case, mean temperature is very close to changing by 1 degree or more and this could have outsized effects on our lives.

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram

```{r, snap_insta}

snap_data <- gss %>%
  filter(!is.na(snapchat),!is.na(instagrm)) %>%
mutate(snap_insta = case_when(snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm=="Yes" ~ "Yes",
                              TRUE ~ "No"))

bootstrap_snap <- snap_data %>% 
  specify(response = snap_insta, success = "Yes") %>%
  generate(reps=1000,type="bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat="prop")
  
bootstrap_snap %>% get_confidence_interval()

 # summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta),
 #            sd_delta = sd(delta),
 #            count = n(),
 #            # get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
 #            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
 #            se_delta = sd(delta)/sqrt(count),
 #            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_delta,
 #            delta_low = mean_delta - margin_of_error,
 #            delta_high = mean_delta + margin_of_error)
 # formula_ci

## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascneding order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

``` {r, education level}

bachelor_data <- gss %>% mutate(degree = factor(degree,levels = c("Lt High School", "High school", "Junior College", "Bachelor", "Graduate"), ordered = TRUE))

bachelor_data <- bachelor_data %>% filter(!is.na(degree)) %>% mutate(bachelor_graduate=case_when((degree=="Bachelor" | degree=="Graduate") ~"Yes", TRUE ~ "No"))

bachelor_data <- bachelor_data %>% filter(bachelor_graduate=="Yes")

bootstrap_twitter <- bachelor_graduate %>% filter(twitter %in% c("Yes","No")) %>% 
  specify(response=twitter, success="Yes") %>%
  generate(reps=1000, type="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat="prop")

bootstrap_twitter %>% get_confidence_interval 

bootstrap_twitter <- bachelor_graduate %>% filter(twitter %in% c("Yes","No")) %>% 
  specify(response=twitter, success="No") %>% 
  generate(reps=1000, type="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat="prop")

bootstrap_twitter %>% get_confidence_interval()


# bachelor_data <- gss 
# bachelor_data$deg
# bachelor_data
 








```

The two confidence intervals do not overlap. From the confidence intervals, we could imply that those with bache


## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
1. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amoung of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?
1. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.
1. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.
```{r, emailusage}
email_data <- gss %>% 
  filter(emailmin != "NA", emailhr != "NA") %>%
  mutate(email = 60 * as.numeric(emailhr) + as.numeric(emailmin))

#Prepare the data for the mean and median lines
email_information <- email_data %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(email, na.rm = TRUE), median = median(email, na.rm = TRUE))

# geom_histogram()+
email_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=email)) +
  geom_density() +
  theme_classic()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")+

 # add mean and median lines
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = email_information$mean, colour = 'mean'), linetype = "dashed", size = 2)  +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = email_information$median, colour = 'median'), linetype = "dashed", size = 2) +
  
  # customize color of mean and median lines
  scale_color_manual(name = NULL, values = c(mean = "#F36F21", median = "#FFF200"))  +
  labs(x = "Minutes spent on email weekly", y="Number of emails sent",
       title = "How much time you really spend emailing each week") +
  theme(text=, plot.title  = element_text (size=20, colour="#7D7D7D"),
        axis.title =  element_text(size=12, colour="#002144"), axis.title.y= element_text(size=12, colour="#002144"))

# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 


# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.


approval_polllist <- approval_polllist  %>%
  mutate(modeldate = mdy(modeldate),startdate = mdy(startdate), enddate = mdy(enddate))
glimpse(approval_polllist)


```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)


approval_polllist_cleaned <- approval_polllist  %>%  
  select(enddate,approve,disapprove ) 
approval_polllist_cleaned

approval_polllist_cleaned$netapprovalrate <- approval_polllist_cleaned$approve - approval_polllist_cleaned$disapprove
approval_polllist_cleaned

approval_polllist_cleaned <- approval_polllist_cleaned %>%  
   mutate (year = year(enddate),
          month = lubridate::month(enddate, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(enddate)) %>%
group_by(year,week) %>%
summarise(mean= mean(netapprovalrate), sd_rate = sd(netapprovalrate),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_rate = sd(netapprovalrate)/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_rate,
            rate_low = mean - margin_of_error,
           rate_high = mean + margin_of_error, .groups = 'drop') 
approval_polllist_cleaned


plot1 <- ggplot(data= approval_polllist_cleaned, mapping = aes(x = week, y = mean, color = year)) +
geom_point()+ geom_line() + theme(legend.position="none") + facet_wrap(~year) + labs( x = " Weak of the year", y = " Average Net Approval %", title = "Estimating Net Approval (approve-disapprove) for Donald Trump", subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls" ) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 52, by = 13))+ scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = -20, to = 7.5, by = 2.5)) + geom_hline(yintercept=0, color = "orange") + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=rate_low, ymax=rate_high), linetype=1, alpha=0.1) + NULL
plot1 

```
We can observe that the range for week 15 is lower than the range for week 34. This means that the degree of certainty of the results is more in week 15 when compared to the degree of certainty of results of week 34. This could be because the average sample size in week 15 is greater than the average sample size in week 34. As the sample size increases, the variation around the mean reduces, giving us a narrower confidence interval.  

# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

view(countries)
view(hiv)
view(life_expectancy)
view(worldbank_data)

```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

``` {r, tidydata}

tidy_life_expectancy <- life_expectancy %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to="year", values_to="life_expect", cols= 2:302) %>% 
  transform(year = as.numeric(year)) %>% 
  drop_na(life_expect)


tidy_hiv_data <- hiv %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to="year", values_to ="hiv_proportion", cols= 2:34) %>% 
  transform(year = as.numeric(year)) %>%
  drop_na(hiv_proportion)  


tidy_world_bank <- worldbank_data %>% 
  rename("GDP_per_capita"=NY.GDP.PCAP.KD, 
         "School_enrollment"= SE.PRM.NENR, 
         "Mortality_rate"=SH.DYN.MORT,
         "Fertility_rate" =SP.DYN.TFRT.IN, 
         "year"=date)

# after cleaning the data, we will join the relevant pieces of data. 


joined_data_1 <- full_join(tidy_hiv_data, tidy_life_expectancy, by = c('country','year'))
joined_data_2 <- full_join(joined_data_1, tidy_world_bank, by = c('country','year'))

joined_data_2


```
``` {r, joindata}

country_data <- left_join(joined_data_2, countries, by = "country")

country_data
tidy_country_data <- country_data %>% 
drop_na()
  
tidy_country_data
  


```


1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful

``` {r, HIV_Life}

ggplot(tidy_country_data, aes(y=life_expect, x=hiv_proportion, na.rm=TRUE))+ 
  geom_point(alpha=0.1)+
  geom_smooth(size=0.5)+
  facet_wrap(~region,scales = "free")+ 
  theme_economist()+
  theme(axis.title = element_text())+
  labs(y="Life Expectancy (Years)", x= "HIV Proportion (%)", title="HIV Rate and Life Expectancy")

```


1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful

```{r, Fertility_GDP}

ggplot(tidy_country_data, aes(y=GDP_per_capita, x=Fertility_rate, na.rm=TRUE))+ 
  geom_point(alpha=0.1, na.rm=TRUE)+
  geom_smooth(na.rm=TRUE)+
  facet_wrap(~region,scales = "free")+ 
  theme_economist()+
  theme(axis.title = element_text())+
  labs(y="GDP Per Capita ($)", x= "Fertility Rate (%)", title="GDP Per Capita and Fertility Rate")


```



1. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.

```{r, missing}
missing_hiv_data <-country_data %>% 
  select("hiv_proportion","region") %>% 
  drop_na(region) %>% 
  filter(is.na(hiv_proportion)) %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  summarise(count =n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))

missing_hiv_data

library(kableExtra)


kbl(missing_hiv_data,col.names=c("Region","Number of NA Values in HIV Data")) %>%
  kable_styling()

1. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.
1. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?

```{r,improvement_data}

# mortality rate by region 

mortality_plot <- tidy_country_data %>%
  group_by(region,year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mortality=mean(Mortality_rate))
mortality_plot


mortality_region <- ggplot(mortality_plot, aes(x=year, y=mean_mortality, group=region)) +

# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# file contains 11 variables and 3.66m rows and is well over 380Mb. 
# It will take time to download

# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

```

Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)

covid_data <- vroom::vroom(url)%>% # If vroom::vroom(url) doesn't work, use read_csv(url)
  clean_names()

covid_clean <- covid_data %>% 
  select(5,6,9,10,11) %>% 
  group_by(age_group,death_yn) %>% 
  filter(death_yn != "Missing",death_yn !="Unknown" , medcond_yn !="Missing", medcond_yn !="Unknown", sex != "Missing",sex != "Other",    sex != "Unknown", icu_yn != "Unknown", icu_yn != "Missing")


covid_death_medcond <- covid_clean %>% 
  group_by(age_group, sex, medcond_yn, death_yn) %>%
  summarise(Number=n()) %>% 
  mutate(Percentage=Number/sum(Number)*100) %>% 
  filter(death_yn=="Yes")

  icu.labs <- c("Addmited ICU", "Not Admitted ICU")
  names(icu.labs) <- c("Yes", "No")

  morb.labs <- c("Comorbidities", "No Comorbidities")
  names(morb.labs) <- c("Yes", "No")
  
ggplot(covid_death_medcond, aes(x=Percentage, y=age_group)) + geom_col(fill="magenta") + facet_grid(cols = vars(sex),

       labs(title = "Covid % death rate by age group, sex and presence of comorbidities", x="% death rate", y="") +
       geom_text(aes(label=round(Percentage, digits = 1)),hjust=0, vjust=0) 

  
  covid_death_icu <- covid_clean %>% 
  group_by(age_group, sex, icu_yn, death_yn) %>%
  summarise(Number=n()) %>% 
  mutate(Percentage=Number/sum(Number)*100) %>% 
  filter(death_yn=="Yes")

ggplot(covid_death_icu, aes(x=Percentage, y=age_group)) + geom_col(fill="purple") + facet_grid(cols = vars(sex), 
       rows = vars(icu_yn), 
       as.table = FALSE, labeller = labeller(icu_yn = icu.labs)) +

       geom_text(aes(label=round(Percentage, digits = 1)),hjust=0, vjust=0)
```



``` {r,primary school enrolment}

# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day),
          week = isoweek(day))
glimpse(bike)

```

We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
bike %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=bikes_hired)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_grid(
    rows = vars(year),
    cols = vars(month),
    scales = "free"
  ) +
    labs(
    title = "Distribution of bikes hired per month",
    x = "Bikes Rentals",
    y = ""
  )
ggplot

```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)

bike2 <- bike  %>%
  filter(year %in% c("2015","2016","2017","2018","2019","2020"))%>%
  group_by(year,month) %>%
  mutate(average_month=mean(bikes_hired)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(year,week)%>%
  mutate(average_week=mean(bikes_hired)) %>%
  ungroup()%>%
  group_by(month)%>%
  mutate(expected_month=mean(bikes_hired))%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  group_by(week)%>%
  mutate(expected_week=mean(bikes_hired)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(excess_month=average_month-expected_month,excess_week=average_week-expected_week)
glimpse(bike2)

# clean the data for monthly average
bikemonth <-bike2 %>%
  select(day,year,month,average_month,expected_month,excess_month) %>%
  group_by(year,month) %>%
  filter(row_number()==1)%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  mutate(excess=ifelse(excess_month<0,"A","B"),
         min=ifelse(excess_month<=0,average_month,expected_month),
         max=ifelse(excess_month>0,average_month,expected_month))
glimpse(bikemonth)

# draw plot of monthly change
  ggplot(bikemonth)+
    facet_wrap(vars(year))+
    geom_line(aes(x=month,y=expected_month,group=1),color="blue")+
    geom_line(aes(x=month,y=average_month,group=1))+
    geom_ribbon(aes(x=month,ymin=min,ymax=expected_month),fill="#fa9fb5",alpha=0.8)+

    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,12,1),labels = c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"))+
    theme(panel.border =element_rect(color="transparent",fill="transparent"),
          panel.background=element_rect(fill="white"),
          panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "#f0f0f0"),

          axis.text.x=element_text(size=5),
          axis.text.y=element_text(size=5))+
    labs(x=NULL,y="Bike rentals",title="Monthly changes in Tfl bike rentals",subtitle = "Change from monthly average shown in blue\nand calculated between 2015-2019")+
    guides(fill=F)

```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)

#clean the data of weekly rentals
bikeweek <- bike2 %>%

  group_by(year,week) %>%
  filter(row_number()==1)%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  mutate(change_rate=excess_week/expected_week,group=ifelse(change_rate>0,"A","B"),rectangle=ifelse(week %in% c(14:26,40:52),"G","W"),min=ifelse(change_rate>0,0,change_rate))
glimpse(bikeweek)

#draw plot of weekly rentals
ggplot(bikeweek)+
  facet_wrap(vars(year))+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=13,xmax=26,ymin=-Inf,ymax=+Inf),fill="#f0f0f0",alpha=0.1)+

  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent,breaks=seq(-0.6,0.6,0.3))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,53,13))+
   theme(panel.border =element_rect(color="transparent",fill="transparent"),
          panel.background=element_rect(fill="white"),
          panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "lightgrey"),

```

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

We should use the mean of the rentals for each month during the 6 years as the expected rentals. The expected value is calculated by multiplying each of the possible outcomes by the likelihood each outcome will occur and then summing all of those values. However, using median number will leave out the effect caused by the possible extreme numbers on the expected value. So, here mean of the rentals is more appropriate to be used as a proxy of the expected value.
